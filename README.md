# Tailwind CSS Practice
[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
is a css utility library that provides low-level classes for styling.

Tailwind CSS is different from bootstrap because it does not define
any high-level component class.
Classes of Tailwind CSS feel like thin wrappers around regular css.
So you do not need to write any css file yourself to use css features.
